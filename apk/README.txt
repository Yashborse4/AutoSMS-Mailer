Build the APK with Android Studio or Gradle:

- Open this project in Android Studio and click Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
- Or run: ./gradlew assembleRelease (on Windows: gradlew.bat assembleRelease)

The resulting file will appear at:
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

Note: This folder is only a placeholder. APKs are generated under app/build/outputs by the Android build system.
